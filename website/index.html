			HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and is used to create webpages and websites. HTML uses elements and tags to define what'll be shown on the webpage.
			Tags are shown by open brackets <> and closed brackets < />. An element is a command inside the brackets, such as <b>&lt;b&gt;
						which makes this text bold, as long as I close the bracket.&lt;/b&gt; </b> Visit <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/default.ASP">this</a> site to find a full list of HTML tags.
					<br>
					<br>
					There are certain tags that are used in every HTML website, that make up the foundation of the website. They are as follows:
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>HTML:</b> This is the root element that goes in the beginning and ending of all your code, and is used to wrap it all up.
					<br>
					<b>Head:</b> This contains the title of the webpage, and links to CSS docs, which we will learn about later.
					<br>
					<b>Body:</b> This is where all the data and coding goes into. The body contains everything the webpage has, be it text, images or videos.
					<br>
					<br>
					A simple code with just these elements in it might look something like this image:
					<br>
					<img src="./images/example.jpg" alt="Image not loading">
					<br>
					<br>
					Go ahead and type this code onto Notepad or another word editor. Add stuff in the body and head, save, then open in browser and see how it looks!
					<br>
					<br>
					If you're on this site, you may be wondering, "Why should I learn HTML over any other coding language?" Well, there are several benefits and drawbacks to HTML.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Advantages:</b>
					<br>
					HTML is simple, basic, and easy to use for beginners
					<br>
					HTML is supported by all browsers
					<br>
					HTML can be integrated with other languages, such as CSS and Javascript
					<br>
					You can add photos and videos easily
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Disadvantages:</b>
					<br>
					Creates static webpages, need to use other languages to create more dynamic webpages
					<br>
					You need a lot of code to create just a simple webpage

					<h3 id="CSS">Learning CSS</h3>
					CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and decribes how HTML elements appear on the webpage.
					It's meant to simplify making pages looks good by creating another language rather than using HTML.
					<br>
					<br>
					The way CSS works is through style rules consisting of a selector and a declaration block.
					The selector selects the HTML element you want to modify, and the declaration block specifies the modifications.
					Let's look at the following image as an example:
					<img src="./images/css example.jpg" alt="Image not loading too bad">
					<br>
					<br>
					In this example, "p" is the selector, and color and text align are the declaration blocks. Any HTML element "p" is going to be colored blue and be center aligned.
					<br>
					<br>
					There are way too many CSS properties to discuss, but you can find the full list <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/">here</a>.
					<br>
					<br>
					You might be thinking, I can just change the way things look inside of HTML. So, why CSS?
					<br>
					<br>
					- CSS is highly reusable, and you can use the same sheet over across multiple HTML pages.
					- Think of HTML as the christmas tree of the website and CSS as all of the decorations. CSS is vital for advanced websites to gain that polished look and add many different functions that also add to the functionality and format of the website.
					<br>
					- It's easy to make changes, you can make updates to every element on the page at once and target individual tags whever you need them.
					<br>
					- CSS has more of a variety when it comes to styling than HTML does, and you can give your page more depth if you use it. You can change color, format, padding, margin, etc with css.
